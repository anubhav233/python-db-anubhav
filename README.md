SRE Test

## Task
```
Your task is to implement a system which has pipelines with quality gates.
You are free to use a CI and CD system of your choice (preferably github actions, circleCI, Jenkins)
Even though this is a small concept program, returned homework should include tests and proper packaging.
instead of integrating service creation and deleting. The above application should be dockerized,
one for the webserver application and the other for the database.

Please note that 
- there are unit tests available in this python application, which you can use for
your quality gates.
- you should be able to deploy this application either on AWS instances/ docker containers on cloud
- your application should have workflows for atleast 2 environments (staging, production)

Bonus points:
- Writing infrastructure code for this application using terraform
- You can deploy the above code on a well structured kubernetes/nomad environment.

IMPORTANT: PLEASE CREATE A BRANCH AND RAISE A PR AGAINST THE MASTER BRANCH

## If you are unable to complete the task, please submit the partial solution which you have done
and write in some additional points as to how you would proceed with the rest of the task.
We will discuss the details in the next round
```
